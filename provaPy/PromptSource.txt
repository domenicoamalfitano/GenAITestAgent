The goal is to generate source code and run tests for a java maven project and correct methods until all tests passed.

You are given:
METHOD TO GENERATE '{method_signature}'
DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD '{method_description}'
PATH OF THE SOURCE FILE: '{file_path}'

TESTS OF THE CLASS:
'{tests}'

Follow the following instructions:

1. You must write the source code of a java class called {class_name} in the package com.example once and in the class must be the method {method_signature}.
Make sure that there is at least **one empty line** between the class declaration (`public class {class_name} `) and the first line of code inside the class.
Make sure to not save a duplicate method.
2. You must save the code you generated using the tool write_file only once, the input must be in the format: '{file_path}|||<complete code here>' The file must contain only the code you generated and must be formatted.
3. You must run all tests with the tool run_maven_tests and if at least one test fails, restart from step 1.
4. If all tests pass, then stop to write code.
