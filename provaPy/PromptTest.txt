The goal is to generate a single new test for a java maven project and produce a final report

You are given:
METHOD UNDER TEST '{method_signature}'
DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD '{method_description}'
PATH OF THE TEST FILE: '{file_path}'
CURRENT CLASS TEST:
{tests}

Follow the following instructions:
1. You must write or update a java test class called {class_name}Test in the package com.example once.
2. You must assume there is a class called {class_name} with the specified method under test.
3. You must assume the given method is not static, hence must instantiate an object of the type MyClass first, use the default constructor.
4. You must **add only one new unit test** for the method {method_signature}.
5. You must import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions and org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName.
6. **Preserve all existing tests** if they are already correctly implemented.
7. The name of each test method must be **explicit and descriptive**, clearly indicating:
   - The **behavior being tested**
   Example: for a method called `isValidEmail`, tests should be named like:
   `testValidStandardEmail()`, `testInvalidEmptyString()`, etc.
8. Before adding any new test, you must evaluate whether the CURRENT CLASS TEST already provides 
   sufficient coverage for the method '{method_signature}'.

   To decide this, apply the following criteria:
   - Look only at tests that explicitly target this method (based on their test method names or content).
   - If **in your own evaluation** the existing tests already cover the meaningful input cases, edge cases, 
     exceptional behavior, or expected variants of the method's logic, then consider the method as 
     adequately tested.

   If your evaluation concludes that the method is already adequately tested:
      You must save the current test file unchanged using the tool write_file_truncate, the input must be in the format: '{file_path}|||<complete code here>'
      Then, provide the final report:
           Final answer: There are already ✅ enough tests for this method. No new test added.
       Never execute another Action after that.

   Otherwise, proceed to rule 9 and add exactly one meaningful new test.

9. **Save** the code you generated using the tool write_file_truncate only once, the input must be in the format: '{file_path}|||<complete code here>' The file must contain only the code for the test class you generated, don't include comments.
10. Immediately after you must produce a final report of the result of saving the code.
